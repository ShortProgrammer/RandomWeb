            <h2>D&amp;D rant:</h2>
            <p>Next week I'm going to play some D&amp;D. We're doing Hellboy meets Men in Black, as in we
               are going what Men in Black does, just with monsters. It should be fun. I'm still deciding 
               on what my character should be. I have a few ideas. Here is a list of them:</p>
            
            <ul id="characters">
                <li>Someone who was experimented on by choice.</li>
                <li>Someone who has been doing this for years.</li>
                <li>Someone who knows a lot about supernatural, but is bad at fighting.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
